# Rock-Paper-Scissors-App
Hey devs, 
This repository contains a small game I made today
**Design** - The Design of the Project is replicated from a FrontEnd Mentor Challenge
**Learnings** - I learnt a lot from this Project. Before this, I made a bunch of mini projects like:
- To Do App
- Weather Api App
- Virtual Piano App
- QR Code Generator App
- Case Converter App

These projects were fairly easy to build and were much smaller as compared to This game
This was the first time I built a game, so it was really fun to build!
